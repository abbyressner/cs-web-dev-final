# CS Web Development Project - T1D Awareness Website

This was a project that I created for my Computer Science Web Development class in my junior year of high school. The website aims to raise awareness about type 1 diabetes.

## Purpose
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management. Through this website, I hope to educate visitors about the causes, symptoms, management, and impact of type 1 diabetes. By increasing awareness, we can foster understanding and support for individuals living with this condition.

## Features
- **Informational Pages**: Explore various aspects of type 1 diabetes, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle management tips.
- **Personal Story**: Read about my personal connection to type 1 diabetes and why raising awareness about this condition is important to me.
- **Resources**: Access links to reputable sources for more in-depth information about type 1 diabetes, support groups, and advocacy organizations.

## Getting Started
