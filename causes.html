            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>
                Type 1 diabetes is caused by the destruction of β-cells – the only 
                cells in the body that produce insulin – and the consequent progressive 
                insulin deficiency. Without insulin, the body is unable to respond 
                effectively to increases in blood sugar and diabetics have persistent 
                hyperglycemia. In 70–90% of cases, β-cells are destroyed by someone's 
                own immune system, for reasons that are not entirely clear. The best-studied 
                components of this autoimmune response are β-cell-targeted antibodies 
                that begin to develop in the months or years before symptoms arise. Typically 
                someone will first develop antibodies against insulin or the protein GAD65, 
                followed eventually by antibodies against the proteins IA-2, IA-2β, and/or 
                ZNT8. People with more of these antibodies, and who develop them earlier in 
                life, are at higher risk for developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes. The 
                trigger for the development of these antibodies remains unclear. A number 
                of explanatory theories have been put forward, and the cause may involve 
                genetic susceptibility, a diabetogenic trigger, and/or exposure to an antigen.
                 The remaining 10–30% of type 1 diabetics have β-cell destruction but no sign 
                 of autoimmunity; this is called idiopathic type 1 diabetes and its cause remains 
                 unclear.

            <h3>Environmental</h3>
            <p>
                Various environmental risks have been studied in an attempt to understand what 
                triggers β-cell autoimmunity. Many aspects of environment and life history are 
                associated with slight increases in type 1 diabetes risk, however the connection 
                between each risk and diabetes often remains unclear. Type 1 diabetes risk is 
                slightly higher for children whose mothers are obese or older than 35, or for 
                children born by caesarean section. Similarly, a child's weight gain in the first 
                year of life, total weight, and BMI are associated with slightly increased type 1 
                diabetes risk. Some dietary habits have also been associated with type 1 diabetes 
                risk, namely consumption of cow's milk and dietary sugar intake. Animal studies and 
                some large human studies have found small associations between type 1 diabetes risk 
                and intake of gluten or dietary fiber; however, other large human studies have found 
                no such association. Many potential environmental triggers have been investigated in 
                large human studies and found to be unassociated with type 1 diabetes risk including 
                duration of breastfeeding, time of introduction of cow milk into the diet, vitamin 
                D consumption, blood levels of active vitamin D, and maternal intake of omega-3 fatty 
                acids. A longstanding hypothesis for an environmental trigger is that some viral 
                infection early in life contributes to type 1 diabetes development. Much of this work 
                has focused on enteroviruses, with some studies finding slight associations with type 1 
                diabetes, and others finding none. Large human studies have searched for, but not 
                yet found an association between type 1 diabetes and various other viral infections, 
                including infections of the mother during pregnancy. Conversely, some have postulated 
                that reduced exposure to pathogens in the developed world increases the risk of autoimmune 
                diseases, often called the hygiene hypothesis. Various studies of hygiene-related factors 
                – including household crowding, daycare attendance, population density, childhood 
                vaccinations, antihelminth medication, and antibiotic usage during early life or pregnancy 
                – show no association with type 1 diabetes.

            <h3>Genetics</h3>
            <p>
                Type 1 diabetes is partially caused by genetics, and family members of type 1 diabetics 
                have a higher risk of developing the disease themselves. In the general population, the 
                risk of developing type 1 diabetes is around 1 in 250. For someone whose parent has type 
                1 diabetes, the risk rises to 1–9%. If a sibling has type 1 diabetes, the risk is 6–7%. 
                If someone's identical twin has type 1 diabetes, they have a 30–70% risk of developing 
                it themselves. About half of the disease's heritability is due to variations in three HLA 
                class II genes involved in antigen presentation: HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1. The 
                variation patterns associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes are called HLA-DR3 
                and HLA-DR4-HLA-DQ8, and are common in people of European descent. A pattern associated 
                with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes is called HLA-DR15-HLA-DQ6. Large genome-wide 
                association studies have identified dozens of other genes associated with type 1 diabetes 
                risk, mostly genes involved in the immune system¹.
