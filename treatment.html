            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                People who have type 1 diabetes can live long, healthy lives. You’ll 
                need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels. Your doctor will 
                give you a range that the numbers should stay within. Adjust your insulin, 
                food, and activities as necessary. Everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to 
                use insulin shots to control their blood sugar.<br><br>
                Several types of insulin are available.<br><br>
                Rapid-acting starts to work in about 15 minutes. It peaks about 1 hour after 
                you take it and continues to work for 2 to 4 hours. Regular or short-acting 
                gets to work in about 30 minutes. It peaks between 2 and 3 hours and keeps 
                working for 3 to 6 hours.<br><br> Intermediate-acting won’t get into your 
                bloodstream for 2 to 4 hours after your shot. It peaks from 4 to 12 hours 
                and works for 12 to 18 hours.<br><br>
                Long-acting takes several hours to get into your system and lasts about 24 hours.

            <h3>Lifestyle Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Exercise is an important part of treating type 1. But it isn’t as simple as going 
                for a run. Exercise affects your blood sugar levels. So you have to balance your 
                insulin dose and the food you eat with any activity, even simple tasks around the 
                house or yard. Knowledge is power. Check your blood sugar before, during, and after 
                an activity to find out how it affects you. Some things will make your levels go up; 
                others won't. You can lower your insulin or have a snack with carbs to keep it from 
                dropping too low. If your blood sugar is high -- above 240 mg/dL -- test for ketones, 
                the acids that can result from high sugar levels. If they’re OK, you should be good 
                to go. If they’re high, skip the workout. You’ll also need to understand how food 
                affects your blood sugar. Once you know the roles that carbs, fats, and protein play, 
                you can build a healthy eating plan that helps keep your levels where they should be. 
                A diabetes educator or registered dietitian can help you get started¹.
