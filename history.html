            <h2>Discovery of diabetes</h2>
            <p>
                Over 3,000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians mentioned a condition that 
                appears to have been type 1 diabetes. It featured excessive urination, 
                thirst, and weight loss. The writers recommended following a diet of 
                whole grains to reduce the symptoms. In ancient India, people discovered 
                that they could use ants to test for diabetes by presenting urine to them. 
                If the ants came to the urine, this was a sign that it contained high sugar 
                levels. They called the condition madhumeha, meaning honey urine. During the 
                third century B.C.E., Apollonius of Memphis mentioned the term “diabetes,” 
                which may have been its earliest reference. In time, Greek physicians also 
                distinguished between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Diabetes 
                insipidus has no link with diabetes mellitus. While it also leads to thirst 
                and urination, it does not affect the body’s production or use of insulin. 
                Diabetes insipidus results from a problem with a hormone called vasopressin 
                that the pituitary gland produces. The ancient Roman doctor Galen mentioned 
                diabetes but noted that he had only ever seen two people with it, which suggests 
                that it was relatively rare in those days. By the fifth century C.E., people in 
                India and China had worked out that there was a difference between type 1 and 
                type 2 diabetes. They noted that type 2 diabetes was more common in heavy, 
                wealthy people than in other people. At that time, this might have implied 
                that these individuals ate more than other people and were less active. 
                Nowadays, the ready supply of processed food has weakened the association 
                between wealth and eating more, but obesity, diet, and a lack of exercise 
                are still risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The term diabetes mellitus comes 
                from the Greek word “diabetes” (to siphon or pass through) and the Latin word 
                “mellitus” (honey or sweet). In the Middle Ages, people believed that diabetes 
                was a disease of the kidneys, but an English doctor in the late 18th century found 
                that it occurred in people who had experienced an injury to the pancreas. In 1776, 
                Matthew Dobson confirmed that the urine of people with diabetes could have a sweet 
                taste. According to an article that the journal Medical Observations and Enquiries 
                published, he measured the glucose in urine and found that it was high in people 
                with diabetes. Dobson also noted that diabetes could be fatal in some people but 
                chronic in others, further clarifying the differences between type 1 and type 2. 
                By the early 19th century, there were no statistics about how common diabetes was, 
                there was no effective treatment, and people usually died within weeks to months of 
                first showing symptoms¹.
