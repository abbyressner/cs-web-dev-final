        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent 
            diabetes, is a chronic condition. In this condition, the pancreas makes 
            little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar 
            (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. Different factors, such as 
            genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 
            diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop 
            in adults. Even after a lot of research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. 
            Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood 
            using insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications¹.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    In the past, type 1 diabetes was always fatal within months or even weeks. 
                    The introduction of insulin as a treatment changed this. There is still no 
                    cure for diabetes, but newer drugs and an awareness of possible causes have 
                    further improved the outlook for people with this condition².<br>

                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                        Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body 
                        attacks itself by mistake). This reaction destroys the cells in the pancreas 
                        that make insulin, called beta cells. This process can go on for months or 
                        years before any symptoms appear³.<br>
